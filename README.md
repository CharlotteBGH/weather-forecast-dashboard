Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

## Description

Since developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API to use in their own code, my challenge was to build a weather dashboard that uses OpenWeather Map's 5 Day Weather Forecast API and runs in the browser to retrieve weather data for user-selected cities.

Featuring dynamically updated HTML and CSS, the weather dashboard utilises geographical coordinates. It is targeted at travellers who want to see the weather forecast for multiple cities so they can plan a trip accordingly. When the user searches for a city using form inputs, they are presented with the current and future conditions for that city, and the city is added to the search history.

## How it works

When a user views the **current** weather conditions for their chosen city, they will see:

- **City name**
- **Date**
- **Icon representation of weather conditions**
- **Temperature**
- **Humidity**
- **Wind speed**

When a user views the **future** weather conditions for their chosen city, they will see:

- **Date**
- **Icon representation of weather conditions**
- **Temperature**
- **Humidity**

When a user clicks on a city in the search history, they will again see the current and future conditions for the city.
